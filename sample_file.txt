Perhaps the hardest Verilog feature for beginners (and even experienced Verilog users are tripped up by it from time to time) is the difference between variables and nets. SystemVerilog consigns the confusion to history: variables may be assigned using procedural assignments, continuous assignments and being connected to the outputs of module instances. Unfortunately, you still can't connect variables to inout ports, although you can pass them using ref ports.
